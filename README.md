# 👋 Hey there, I'm Harshitha Sha!

 I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Technology student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cybersecurity**, based in the UAE.

I’m passionate about exploring how intelligent systems and secure technologies work — and more importantly, how they can work **together**. I enjoy experimenting with different tools, frameworks, and hands-on labs to learn and grow in both fields.

This GitHub space is where I:
- Try out new concepts
- Break down complex ideas into practical examples
- 🛠Practice turning theory into real-world application
- Share ongoing experiments in cybersecurity, AI, and data-driven projects
