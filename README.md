# 👋 Hey there, I'm Harshitha Sha!

 I'm currently a Bachelor of Information Technology student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cybersecurity**.

I'm especially curious about how smart systems can stay secure, and how security can get smarter. I love experimenting with tools, frameworks, and real-world challenges that help me bridge the gap between what we learn in class and what actually works in practice.

This GitHub space is where I:
- Explore new ideas through small (and sometimes weird) projects
- Turn tricky concepts into hands-on examples
- Practice breaking, building, and securing things 
- Share write-ups and walkthroughs from rooms, demos, and data experiments

Learning by doing is my favorite way to grow — and if it breaks along the way, that’s just part of the fun!
